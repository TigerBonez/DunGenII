# DunGenII

A primitive solo D&D random generation suite built to practice Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Can also be used in larger games, especially when the DM is also involved as a player themselves.
Uses many resources found in official Dungeon & Dragons books, such as the Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and the Monster Manual.
Also uses an oracle system directly based off of "MUNE", a solo D&D DM emulator.

This is meant to be a private project for a few friends and I, but I wanted to see if I can host the files as a website using github, which requires it to be listed as public. If you end up using this, be sure to support the original sources this is based on.
